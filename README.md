# Social Network API

## Description

I created this Social Network API in order to create an interactive database where users can create a User, add other users as Friends, post Thoughts and add or remove Reactions to those Thoughts. I am able to view Users, their associated friends, Thoughts, and associated Reactions. I am able to add Users, update Users, remove Users, add other users as Friends, remove Users as friends, create Thoughts, update Thoughts, remove Thoughts, React to thoughts, and remove Reactions from Thoughts. This application utilizes Node and Express.js to create the application routes, MongoDB and mongoose to create and modify the database, and Insomnia to test and present all working capabilities. I learned how to improve coding structure and accessibility of MongoDB databases utilizing mongoose, learned a new way to execute Express.js routes, and conducted testing of routes and database capabilities with Insomnia.
